Environment variables

HOME - user's home directory

PATH - directories which are searched for commands

HOSTNAME - hostname of the machine

SHELL - shell that is being used

Like own internal variables, but are defined elsewhere (in another program)

[ -z ] : checks for an empty string

PATH="/" : Changes path name

Environment variables will always revert back to how they
were before the script ran
